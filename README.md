### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I felt all the topics in the labs, especially the third lab, prepared me to complete the basic goals of the assignment. The giphy party lab was the skeleton I needed to make external api calls, and allowed me to use that for this assignment. Adding the popup took me some time to complete because I needed to think about where each piece will go, and hooking everything up to make sure they worked took some time as well.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
I would have added animations and improved on formatting if I had more time. Next, I would have focused more on accessibility and speed for my site to load. I also wanted to make sure it was compatible with as many browsers as possible since not a lot of versions support css grid. I really liked my approach with hiding certain divs based on if the user was searching or just wanted to look at the current movies, however this hurts accessibility as screen readers might have trouble reading them, so I would have changed that as well.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
